        "... (We start) from the premise that conflict is natural, normal, and
        recurrent in community life. When conflict occurs, it doesn’t mean
        anyone has failed. In fact, we need both community and conflict to reach
        our full potential as human beings. Much as we value individual choice,
        we are formed in community and work out the ramifications of our
        individuality in relation to others. And though we may resent it when
        our preferences, practices, or beliefs are challenged, we would never
        grow without conflict." – Ron Kraybill & Evelyn Wright

    <p>
      On July 13th at the Town Hall a presentation on the principles and
      practice of Restorative Circles was offered by L’aura and Jason, followed
      by a question and answer session. Over the years they have been excited
      about living nonviolence and learning about processes that help
      communities create cooperation and harmony. So last November they attended
      a Restorative Circles workshop in the US, and spending time with Dominic
      Barter, the founder of the process, was rich and rewarding. They returned
      both moved and impressed, and are now motivated to share the practice with
      Auroville and interested people in India. A group of Aurovilians is
      meeting weekly to practice the skills with the possible intention of one
      day creating a restorative justice system in Auroville.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dominic moved to Rio de Janeiro 17 years ago after falling in love
      with a Brazilian, he had no background in handling conflict. He found
      himself moved by the imbalance of power between those who lived in the
      slums and those who didn’t, and he began to talk to people. He noticed
      they frequently wanted to discuss the conflicts in their lives, and
      expressed that they felt disempowered and unable to handle them. So for
      the past 15 years, Dominic has been working with Brazilians to develop
      this process, so that they could trust their communities to handle their
      conflicts without needing outside authorities to intervene. At first he
      thought of himself in the field of ‘conflict resolution,’ but he has come
      to realize that conflict is part of coexistence and that, rather than
      trying to fix conflicts, he wants to encourage them to fully blossom. For
      this, Dominic refers to creating dedicated ‘fight rooms’ so that everybody
      involved can take responsibility for finding the roots of the conflict and
      empower themselves to create solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the way most people perceive conflict is overly simplistic: one
      victim and one offender. Many people may be affected by a conflict and
      many of them may be experiencing themselves in a state of ‘victimhood’ –
      that is, the power to affect their wellbeing is out of their reach. In a
      Restorative Circle, all the parties participating in the process get a
      chance to express themselves and be heard not just for the words they
      speak but for the meaning they want registered. It’s not about who’s right
      or wrong – it’s about understanding how people feel now about what
      happened and what their motivations were when they chose to act.
      Ultimately, it’s the recognition of a shared humanity. From that
      foundation, the Circle can try to find a way forward which serves
      everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>So, how does it work?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A Restorative Circle brings together the three parties in a conflict –
      those who have acted, those directly impacted, and the wider community –
      within a specific context to dialogue as equals. The first step is for a
      person experiencing conflict to contact a facilitator. The facilitator
      then holds a Pre-Circle with that person to identify the act in question
      and to understand how the person feels about it now. The facilitator then
      makes sure that the person understands the Circle process and asks if he
      or she wants to go ahead. If yes, the facilitator asks who else needs to
      be present in the Circle. He or she then proceeds to have Pre-Circles with
      all of the other parties, and invites them to describe the conflict and
      how it impacted them, and asks them who they think should participate in
      the Circle. Finally, the facilitator invites everybody to the Restorative
      Circle, where they get the chance to share how they feel about the
      conflict. From here, the focus of the dialogue shifts to understanding the
      underlying causes of people’s actions. The Circle ends when the
      participants reach a practical, time-framed action plan which they believe
      will start to restore trust and meet the needs of everybody involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Post-Circle is scheduled after the action plan’s completion date, and
      the parties get a chance to discuss how these actions impacted their
      wellbeing. If needs have been met they can be celebrated and if there are
      still unmet needs, new actions can be agreed upon. Dominic describes the
      intended outcome of the Circle as each participant being more willing to
      co-exist with the others than before they entered the Circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the question and answer session, one of the participants was
      inspired to share a story of hope about handling conflict. While walking
      in Australia, he and his wife were witness to a scene of violence
      involving an Aboriginal man who ran after them enraged, threatening
      violence. His wife turned and walking directly to the man, took his arms
      and said: “When you bleed, it’s red. When I bleed it’s red. Do we have to
      hurt each other?” The man replied, shocked: “Do you really mean that?” And
      she said: “Yes, I really mean that.” He ended his story sharing: “Arms
      went down, and he went away, and we went away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t have to be afraid of conflict – it can be a way of uniting us and
      helping us to enjoy each others’ differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end another person asked, “Due to all the diversity, pain and
      history in Auroville, do you believe it will work here?” L’aura responded,
      “It would be foolish of me to promise yes – but, I trust this process and
      I’m willing to try.”

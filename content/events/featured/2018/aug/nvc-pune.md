**A path of Nonviolence** offers both a deeply-rooted consciousness of oneness, as well as very practical tools to live this more and more in our daily lives. In re-evaluating some of our habitual and conditioned thinking, we see how much of it is life-alienating and based on a culture of scarcity and separation. We’ll learn the skills to be able express ourselves with more clarity and to hear others’ true (and harmless) message, which in turn leads to more connection between us. When we’re connected as human beings, we’re in our natural state of wanting to give and collaborate with others.

**The workshop balances theory and practice.** We'll develop an understanding of NVC, and learn to embody these principles in our lives, moment-to-moment. Ideal for participants at beginner level (no prior training in NVC), but also suitable for those at intermediate level (5-10 days of NVC training) who are wanting to deepen their NVC.

**L'aura Joy** is one of only four Nonviolent Communication (CNVC) certified trainers in India and has been a practitioner and teacher of NVC since 2007.

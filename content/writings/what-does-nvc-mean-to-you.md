Workshop participants’ brainstorming responses to “What does NVC mean to you…?”

* deeper understanding and connection before the trigger even arises
* is it too mental, analyzed?
* self-behaviour has to change first
* provides ability to embrace other people’s judgements and not take personally
* listen and understand self and others
* balance
* not about communication
* I stop reacting (vicious circle)
* clear, simple way to be present, not judge, feel myself
* treating my child with respect, as a human being
* spiritual practice: practical practice to live a higher consciousness
* presence, so that I can identify my feelings and not project them on others
* vulnerability
* integrating into my everyday environment
* embracing what is
* breathing before talking
* true intentions, transparency, authenticity
* patience with myself
* putting (e)motions in positive change
* being aware (getting rid) of labels
* mindful communication
* letting go of judgements

      [Feelings of discrimination surfaced after two Tamil members of the
      Working Committee were not given proximity passes for the Prime Minister's
      visit on February 24th. This led to a rift within the Working Committee,
      and the debate spilled over into the larger community. The Auroville
      Council, asked by many members of the community to look into the matter of
      feelings of discrimination, called for a Restorative Circle to support the
      Working Committee to work through some of their internal dynamics. In
      addition, Restorative Auroville also organized a Cross-Cultural Dialogue
      on the topic of discrimination. L'aura reports.]

      Although I can connect with the discomfort that many Aurovilians felt with
      regards to the recent claim of discrimination being published on Auronet,
      I’m actually celebrating the courage and clarity that it took to name it,
      and to do so this publicly. And instead of spending time and energy on
      defending or disproving the claim, I wish we would simply acknowledge the
      legitimacy of the inquiry, whether true during the Prime Minister’s visit
      or not, and take this incident as a real opportunity to reflect deeply on
      how we live and work together in Auroville – and especially now, after our
      50 years together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m reminded of some of the comments we received as we were planning our
      first Cross-Cultural Dialogue two years ago (September 2016). “You are
      opening a dangerous conversation; you would be better off not getting into
      it.” “There’s no discrimination in Auroville; you are looking for problems
      where none exist.” “If you raise this topic so openly, you will encourage
      the Tamil community to feel justified in their victimhood.” I was quite
      horrified hearing these comments, which I in turn disregarded and judged
      as denial and non-willingness to engage with something that would clearly
      be an uncomfortable, yet radically revealing, conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yes, of course it’s uncomfortable! Strong emotions, blame, judgements,
      not understanding each other, maybe not even really wanting to understand
      each other, because maybe choosing what’s familiar is easier. And yet, at
      the end of that first Cross-Cultural Dialogue journey together, the 55
      Aurovilians who participated felt a deeper connection with one another,
      and there was gratitude for the scary honesty that was expressed, as it
      provided an opportunity for a heartfelt sharing and introspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the biggest take-aways from that Dialogue (2016) was acknowledging
      how easily we, as individuals and as a community, can jump to conclusions
      about people’s behaviour, based on what labels and stereotypes we place on
      them, and indeed we neglect to seek connection or to understand what might
      have motivated the person’s choices in that moment. For example, we might
      label one group as arrogant and treating others as less worthy, and
      another group as not understanding the ideals of Auroville. Several
      Aurovilians in the room expressed a commitment to engage with our fellow
      brothers and sisters as individuals, and to be curious about who we are as
      unique human beings, instead of clubbing one other into stereotyped
      groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we prepared for our second and more recent Cross-Cultural Dialogue
      (April 2018), the comments were of a very different nature. “It’ll all
      just be a waste of time; we’ll sit around and say nice things, but nothing
      will actually change in Auroville.” “We won’t get anywhere on this topic,
      because the real people who need to be there won’t come; you should force
      them to come and take responsibility.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet interestingly, two years later, and clearly marked by the
      wake-up-call during our 50th anniversary events, the conversation among
      the 47 Aurovilians who joined this second Cross-Cultural Dialogue was
      palpably intensified and riskier than the first one. And almost every
      person in the room expressed, in their own way, that undoubtedly non-Tamil
      Aurovilians do discriminate against the local Tamil community in
      Auroville.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was strikingly touching about this Dialogue was how much space was
      both taken and given, spontaneously, for Tamil Aurovilians to express
      themselves. They said that never before had they experienced such a safe
      and open space to share and be heard for their story. What I registered
      was a rich array of human depth, from sharing about painful experiences,
      to deep questions about our distinct paradoxes in Auroville, to true
      commitment and intention to serve Auroville, to simple unassuming
      acceptance of our differences in education and lifestyle, to courageous
      honesty in disclosing internal dynamics and “politics,” and to dreaming
      and aspiring to create a better world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, just as in many other Auroville conversations and platforms, we often
      seem unable, as a community, to translate our meaningful experience
      together into something that’s felt tangibly in the community. For
      example, a resounding plea in the room was for a more balanced cultural
      representation in Auroville’s governance structure and working groups. So
      how do we shift something systemically, at the core of how we function, to
      truly include and embrace all of us? If Mother said that the simple Indian
      villager is closer to the divine than the educated Westerner, it seems
      unfair that we place more merit on fluency in English and computer skills
      than on other forms of knowledge and wisdom. So how do we start to truly
      meet each other, without our ideas of being separate?

    <p>In response to John's question:</p>
    <p>
      I'm missing a reference to the deterring effect of punishments. An
      important reason to go for punitive justice is deterrence, how is that in
      restorative systems?
    </p>
    <p>I love this question. It really invites for reflection...</p>
    <p>
      I think the main difference here between punitive and restorative justice
      is the approach. I think both forms of justice acknowledge that some of
      our human behaviour can disrupt the harmonious functioning of society, and
      as a result, both forms of justice attempt to put structures and processes
      in place that will hopefully support to create and maintain a just,
      harmonious, and safe society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punitive system’s approach (or one of its approaches) is to use
      punishment as a deterring factor – hoping that the threat or fear of being
      punished will dissuade people from committing crime, thus creating a more
      harmonious society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think restorative justice takes on a totally different approach. Instead
      of focusing on the need to control/dissuade people from acting badly,
      restorative justice aims at restoring – restoring what has been broken,
      not only as a result of the painful act, but also at the foundation of our
      systems, which causes people to feel like “acting badly” is the only way
      they can be heard or have a sense of power in their world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think restorative justice also acknowledges that it’s safer, in the long
      run, to face the fact that we live and function in community, and that in
      reality we can’t exclude “the bad ones” – or if we attempt such a thing,
      it easily invites retaliation, and likely in more harmful ways. So
      instead, it focuses on restoring and rebuilding what’s lacking at the core
      – our trust in one another, our sense of being heard, mattering and
      belonging, and our oneness as a community. A lot of this is achieved
      through honest and open dialogue, where each person has a chance to
      express themselves and be heard, and from this space, coming to a mutual
      agreement for how to move forward, how to take responsibility for our
      actions, and how to re-integrate into the community those who have caused
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the deterring factor in restorative justice isn’t actually about
      deterrence – instead, it’s an invitation to act with responsibility, a
      reminder that we all share the same core human values, a felt-sense that
      when we know we belong and matter, we naturally want to contribute to the
      well-being of the whole, and an understanding that when we don’t honour
      these values and hurt others, we end up hurting ourselves as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think punitive justice is based on power structures, and those in power
      decide what the punishments should be. Restorative justice invites shared
      power, where agreements and consequences are decided upon together and in
      response to the unique elements of each case.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d like to give a very simplified example: I find out that my son has
      stolen money. I’m sure he knows he’ll be in trouble if/when I find out -
      like I might not allow him to go out over the weekend, I might limit his
      internet access, I might make him apologise and return the money, or I
      might beat him. But apparently this hasn’t stopped him from stealing the
      money. Hmm… why not? It seems here fear of punishment hasn’t worked as a
      deterrent. (And in general, I think if this strategy worked, we wouldn’t
      have as much crime in the world as we have. We seem to have a lot of
      punishment and threat of punishment, but it doesn’t seem to have stopped
      people from committing crime!)
    </p>
    <p>
      With a restorative approach, I might very well be angry and shocked and
      embarrassed, but I also want to check in with my son and understand what
      was going on for him. Was he wanting to buy a new phone for his
      girlfriend’s birthday (so wanting to express care and be seen as someone
      special)? Was he just bored and looking for a thrill (need for excitement,
      or power in his world)? Or was he coerced into doing this by his peers as
      a way of “proving himself” (need for safety and belonging)? Or...? So it’s
      just so complex… And how does he feel about it now? Is he embarrassed,
      does he have regret, is he in denial or in rage, is he wanting to act out
      even worse, is he thinking about how to get smarter so that next time he
      doesn’t get caught…? I think understanding and acknowledging all of these
      elements is much more likely to bring about constructive change in my son
      than the simple hope that fear of punishment will be a deterrence.
    </p>

      At the ARA meeting last week, Jaya shared a statistic that I liked very
      much. I hope I understood it correctly - that 3% of our human population
      doesn’t abide by "acceptable" social conduct, 12% can cause minor
      disturbances, and the rest of us are just going about life doing the best
      we can to live in peace and harmony. So rules and punishments are created
      as a fire-fighting response to the behaviour of the 3% (but applied to
      everyone), as an attempt to regain control and reestablish perceived
      social normalcy. But for me the question is: Does it work? Does it
      actually deter the 3% from acting out in painful ways? I don’t think so,
      as we still have so much crime. Maybe it works on the rest of us (ie. the
      other 97% of us don’t commit crime because we’re afraid of punishment), or
      we just have a sense of belonging and co-responbility in creating a
      harmonious society. This, in my opinion, is the deterrence – we’ve
      developed an inner consciousness and choose to act in alignment with our
      values. So, for me, the focus should be on how we can re-ignite this inner
      consciousness in the hearts and souls of the 3% (for whom punishment
      doesn’t seem to work anyway).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s begin to look at what it takes to restore what’s broken, and from
      here (re-)create the society we’re all longing for – one of trust, safety,
      belonging, togetherness, integrity, and higher aspiration…
    </p>
    <p>John responds again, and I clarify my point.</p>
    <p>Thanks for your response, John.</p>
    <p>
      I regret if I gave the impression that we need to do away with the
      punitive system or that it has no value in society. This was not my
      intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I commented to my mom that I could actually write a book in response to
      your question, so then the challenge comes in how to be concise and yet
      still thorough :-). Impossible on a subject like this, especially since
      I'm passionate about it...
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I can be quite critical of the punitive system, yes, because for
      me it has so many holes in it. And I guess what I'm actually pointing to
      are the holes (not necessarily the system), and behind that, the longing
      to find something which is more genuine, more true to our ideals in
      Auroville, and also connected to our basic human values (which I believe
      we all have, even the so-called "bad" people).
    </p>
    <p>
      And John, when you point out our present situation in Auroville and its
      disfunctionality, I fully agree... And I'm guessing you would love to see
      us figure it out for once and for all, and come up with a construtive
      wholesome way of responding to conflict, ya...? Am I getting you? Me too,
      I'd love this...!
    </p>
    <p>
      I agree that the two systems can run in parallel (as in Janet's example in
      Brazil), but the challenge is that at present we have neither in Auroville
      – or at least not functioning in full capacity.
    </p>
    <p>And this is our paradox.</p>
    <p>
      So if we had punishment in Auroville (or "improved" our present
      punishments), what would it look like? How would we punish people (what
      exactly would be the punishment)? How would we decide, and who would
      decide, who should be punished and how? And would this punishment be
      enforceable? How? And would it give us the desired results? A community
      with more harmony, integrity, trust, safety...?
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I'm not convinced. I'd prefer to take a different approach
      altogether – to find a way of going deeper and looking at what separated
      us in the first place, where we started to lose trust in each other, and
      how we can start to rebuild this trust. I believe this is a more
      sustainable approach, something that will invite more long-lasting,
      genuine change – but of course it's very likely a much slower process and
      may not bring about any immediate "visible" results of "law and order."
      (But what would...?)
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, punishment is a band-aid, and it's a band-aid that doesn't always
      work – ie. restore a sense of balance and harmony in society and among
      individuals. Instead, I think what might work better would be to look at
      the wound itself and look at ways to restore what has been broken. Why is
      this person acting this way? Was he harmed in any way prior to his
      "wrongful act"? What is he desperately trying to say and be heard for?
      Isn't he, in his limited and desperate way, also trying to restore balance
      (even if his choices are obviously poor ones)? Let's look at his plea, his
      plight and respond to that, instead of simply trying to deal with the
      external manifestation (crime to society) of his present inner human
      complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, for me, is the deterring power (maybe not with 100% success, but so
      far, what is?) of restorative justice. When we shift our focus instead to
      our shared humanity, we are touched and want to change (all of us, not
      just the “bad" ones). In the long term, I think knowing that we belong,
      that we matter, that we’re loved, that we trust each other as a community,
      is much more of an incentive to living in harmony (or a “deterrent” to
      “bad behaviour”) than simply creating rules and attempting to enforce
      punishments. What practices can we put into place that reconnect us with
      our biggest human need, that is, to contribute to the well-being of one
      another? And from here, with all this in consideration, to come up with an
      action plan – that, by the way, might be just as “harsh” as a punishment,
      but the intention and method for coming to this place is totally
      different. An action plan might be that someone needs to leave the
      community for one year – but the difference is that this decision comes
      from a larger group process, including the "wrong-doer" and their best
      intentions, and the intention is to restore trust, community, safety – not
      to punish.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here I go again... Sharing a lot, and with a lot of energy. I'm sorry
      if it comes across as too one-sided... I'm actually just longing to find a
      REAL way forward in Auroville, one that works and that we can apply and
      that gets us where we want to go... I imagine you want this too...?
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is not to say that I think we should take a laissez-faire
      attitude. Let's really get down to figuring this out and having real,
      serious dialogue about these issues in Auroville – that we desperately
      lack a justice system.

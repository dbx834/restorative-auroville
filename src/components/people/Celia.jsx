      I grew up in France in a family where conflict, trust and love co-existed.
      After a conflict between 2 members (or more), we would usually sit
      together with another member who will act as a mediator. Our technique was
      far from perfect but it enable us to look at our wounds, express them to
      the others and be heard. It was a very nice experience for myself and i
      also learnt to offer it for others. I always had an attraction for
      conflict resolution and deep communication. I even discovered later that I
      am "the Mediator" in the MBTI personality types.

      When I arrived in Auroville I first heard about Nonviolent Communicaton
      and I fell in love with it and amazed by the person teaching it (L'aura),
      this is what I needed! I learnt how to listen deeply to another person,
      and how to create connection. Through this NVC practice I heard about
      Restorative Circle, which is for me the implementation of NVC in a
      community. I like that it gives clear guidelines about the process. I'm
      still very new to all this but i'm already super trustful in its magic and
      I'm excited to learn its facilitation.
